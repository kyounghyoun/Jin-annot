=========

Scripts for annotating a genome with RNA-seq and Protein sequence data.

This repository holds scripts and programs that was used to 
annotate a plant genome using RNA-seq and annotation of other 
sequenced genomes.

# RepeatMask
## Repeat Modeling
## Actual Repeat Masking

# CEGMA

# Iterative Augustus
## Map the RNA-seq data to the masked genome with tophat
## extract exon junctions
## map the RNA-seq to exon junctions using bowtie2

## Map protein sequence data to genome using exonerate
## construct combined hint data.
## split genome
## Run Augustus on split genome
